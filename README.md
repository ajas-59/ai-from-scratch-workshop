# AI from Scratch — Workshop Summary & Code

This repository contains my notes and code from the **"AI from Scratch"** workshop, designed to give hands-on experience with modern AI development tools, especially for working with language models - presented by Dr Yasin Ceran and Dr Murat Bday.

## 🚀 What I Learned

### 🐍 Python for AI
- Refresher on Python basics with a focus on AI applications
- Practical scripting for data handling and model integration

### 📚 NLP & Transformer Architectures
- How machines process text (tokenization, embeddings)
- Understanding self-attention and the Transformer model
- Introduction to Hugging Face Transformers

### ✨ Prompt Engineering
Rule-Based Prompting with the definition of clear constraints and behavior guidlines :

  | Under 100 words
  
  | Reformulate
  
  | Include a practical example

### 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Combining LLMs with private or external data
- Using vector databases and embedding models to enable context-aware generation

### 🔗 LangChain for LLM Workflows
- Chaining tools, prompts, and memory modules into custom pipelines
- Structure influencing the building of simple apps combining LLMs and document retrieval

## 💼 Skills Gained
- Proficiency in using Python for LLM pipelines
- Hands-on experience with Hugging Face and LangChain
- Solid understanding of RAG principles and prompt design
